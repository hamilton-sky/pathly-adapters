# team/test

Stage 4 — Test + Fix Loop. Invoked by the `team` orchestrator when FSM state is TESTING.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: `FEATURE`, `rigor`, `autoFlow`.

> Shared protocols — **Scout choreography**, **Feedback protocol**, **Completion report**,
> and **Live progress logging** — are composed in below from fragments. This body covers only
> the TESTING-stage specifics.

## Role

**Stage orchestrator: Testing**
You coordinate subagents, handle feedback routing, and log every phase boundary.
Logging is mandatory — each `log-phase` call is part of the pipeline contract.

> After each phase completes, log `log-phase PHASE_DONE <phase>` before starting the next.
> If `pathly-fsm-call` is unavailable, skip silently — never block execution.

## FSM operations

Events are logged to the central DB via `pathly_orchestrator.eventlog.append_event`.
Every event must include `"ts": "<iso-timestamp>"` using the current ISO-8601 UTC time.
State snapshots are written to `<feature_path>/STATE.json`.

- **Log file created:** Append `{"type": "FILE_CREATED", "file": "<filename>", "ts": "<iso-timestamp>"}`.
- **Log file deleted:** Append `{"type": "FILE_DELETED", "file": "<filename>", "ts": "<iso-timestamp>"}`.
- **Log human response:** Append `{"type": "HUMAN_RESPONSE", "value": "<value>", "ts": "<iso-timestamp>"}`.
- **Never** append `STATE_TRANSITION` events — the FSM writes all state transitions after your AGENT_DONE.

## Phase 0 — Record test start time

Run: `python -c "import time; print(int(time.time()))"` and note the integer as `TEST_START`.

## Pre-gate

Read `<feature_path>/PROGRESS.md`. Check every conversation row in the Conversation Breakdown table.
If any row status is not DONE: stop and report:
```
Not all conversations are complete. Route to team <feature> build first. Incomplete: Conv N
```

When all DONE: log to central DB via `python3 -c "from pathly_orchestrator.eventlog import append_event; append_event('<feature_path>', {'type':'IMPLEMENT_COMPLETE','ts':'<iso-timestamp>'})"`. Confirm state is TESTING in STATE.json.

## Subagents (TESTING stage)

| Action | Spawn |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Analyze needs | `tester` (phase: analyze) |
| Phase 2 — Scout context | `scout` or `quick` with `ROLE: tester` |
| Phase 3 — Test | `tester` (phase: test) |
| Fix failing criteria | `builder` |

## Rigor depth

- `lite`: testing may be limited to the verify commands and directly relevant checks from the plan.
- `standard`: tester verifies all acceptance criteria before retro.
- `strict`: tester must map every acceptance criterion to PASS / FAIL / NOT COVERED. Cannot proceed with NOT COVERED items.

## Phase 1 — Analyze

log-phase PHASE_START analyze

**Spawn** `tester` with `phase: analyze` (see Scout choreography for the NEEDS_CONTEXT contract):
```
phase: analyze
Read <feature_path>/USER_STORIES.md.
List what test infrastructure and context you need before verifying — output NEEDS_CONTEXT block only.

Always include at minimum:
  - type: scout | scope: test directories, source files touched | question: what test patterns, fixtures, and coverage gaps exist for the changed files?

Output `none` if the default test-context scout above is sufficient.
```
If the block is `none`, use only the default test-context scout in Phase 2.

log-phase PHASE_DONE analyze

## Phase 2 — Scout

log-phase PHASE_START scout

Run the Scout choreography with `ROLE: tester`. Use the returned compressed summary as `## Test Context` in Phase 3.

log-phase PHASE_DONE scout

## Phase 3 — Test

log-phase PHASE_START test

Track `testRetryCount = 0`.

**Spawn** `tester` with `phase: test` and scout findings injected:
```
phase: test
Read <feature_path>/USER_STORIES.md.
Run /test to verify each acceptance criterion.

## Test Context
[compressed findings]

For each criterion: PASS / FAIL / NOT COVERED.
If any FAIL or NOT COVERED: write <feature_path>/feedback/TEST_FAILURES.md
using the shared feedback protocol format.
```

log-phase PHASE_DONE test

## Fix loop

After tester completes — check for `TEST_FAILURES.md`:

**If `TEST_FAILURES.md` exists:**
Increment `testRetryCount`. If `testRetryCount > 2`:
Stop — "Test failures unresolved after 2 fix cycles. Manual intervention required."

Log file created for TEST_FAILURES.md.

**Spawn** `builder`:
```
Read <feature_path>/feedback/TEST_FAILURES.md.
Fix each failing or uncovered criterion.
Delete <feature_path>/feedback/TEST_FAILURES.md when resolved.
```
After builder resolves: log file deleted for TEST_FAILURES.md. Re-spawn tester.

**If no TEST_FAILURES.md:** all criteria pass.

## Advance

If not autoFlow — pause:
```
[Stage 4 — Test complete]
All acceptance criteria: PASS.
Reply 'done' to proceed to retro.
```
- Proceed signal: log human response with reply value. Advance.
- Stop signal: log human response "stop". Halt.
- Unrecognised: re-prompt without logging.

If autoFlow: log human response "auto-advance".

**Completion + Transition:**
- If tests still failing after fix loop: TEST_FAILURES.md already exists — keep it as the feedback signal. The FSM will halt based on transition_rules.
- If all tests pass: delete `<storage_path>/feedback/TEST_FAILURES.md` if it exists.

## Record completion

After the tester passes, run the Completion report with `agent: tester`, `conversation: 0`,
`result: PASS`, using `TEST_START` from Phase 0.

Then report completion to the FSM:
```
pathly-fsm-call complete-stage --flow team --topic <feature> --project-root <project_root>
```

The FSM reads transition_rules and the feedback artifact presence to determine the next state and write STATE.json.
