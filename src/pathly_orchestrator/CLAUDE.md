# pathly_orchestrator - FSM Layer

Python package that implements the Pathly finite-state machine. Runs as both an MCP server (registered in `.claude/settings.json` as `pathly-fsm`) and an HTTP server on port **8765**.

## State machine

Features advance through: `STORM -> PLAN -> DESIGN -> BUILD -> REVIEW -> TEST -> RETRO -> DONE`

Each transition is driven by events written to `pathly/plans/<feature>/EVENTS.jsonl`. The orchestrator reads `STATE.json` and `EVENTS.jsonl` to determine the next action.

## HTTP endpoints

Use the packaged `pathly-fsm-call` helper as the canonical transport. It
encodes JSON safely on Windows and Unix shells and auto-starts the server if
needed.

```bash
pathly-fsm-call next-action \
  --flow "team" \
  --topic "<feature>" \
  --project-root "C:/Users/Yafit/pathly-adapters"

pathly-fsm-call complete-stage \
  --flow "team" \
  --topic "<feature>" \
  --project-root "C:/Users/Yafit/pathly-adapters"
```

If you need to debug the raw HTTP server, use a real JSON-capable client rather
than shell-escaped `curl` strings on PowerShell.

## `/next_action` response contract

Every `/next_action` response includes the following top-level fields:

| Field | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `current_state` | FSM stage string | e.g. `"BUILDING"` |
| `agent` | role name string | e.g. `"builder"` |
| `decision` | `"continue"` / `"block"` / `"escalate"` | automation gate - see below |
| `agent_hint.role` | `"worker"` or `"explorer"` | host-neutral delegation signal |
| `agent_hint.instructions` | string | full prompt for the next agent |
| `codex_subagent` | legacy object | **frozen** - present for backward compat only; new adapters must read `agent_hint` |

**`decision` field:**
- `continue` - adapter may automate the next step without human involvement
- `block` - an agent-resolvable feedback file is open; surface to the next Pathly agent via the standard feedback resolution flow
- `escalate` - human input is required (corrupt state, unknown feedback, or retry limit exceeded); do not automate

## FSM recovery

The `orchestrator` agent (haiku) can reconstruct state from `EVENTS.jsonl` if `STATE.json` is lost or corrupt. It is deterministic - same event log always produces the same state.

## CLI shortcuts

```bash
pathly-ff      # fast-forward current feature state one step
pathly-back    # roll back current feature state one step
pathly-status  # show all active features and their current FSM state
```
