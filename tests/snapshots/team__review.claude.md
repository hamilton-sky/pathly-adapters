# team/review

Stage 3b — Review. Invoked by the `team` orchestrator when FSM state is REVIEWING.
Runs reviewer for the current conversation, handles feedback loops, then advances.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: `FEATURE`, `rigor`, `autoFlow`. Conv N is the most recent BUILDING conversation
(last row in PROGRESS.md that is not yet DONE).

> Shared protocols — **Scout choreography**, **Feedback protocol**, **Completion report**,
> **Sub-agent spawning rules**, and **Live progress logging** — are composed in below from
> fragments. This body covers only the REVIEWING-stage specifics.

## Role

**Stage orchestrator: Reviewing**
You coordinate subagents, handle feedback routing, and log every phase boundary.
Logging is mandatory — each `log-phase` call is part of the pipeline contract.

> After each phase completes, log `log-phase PHASE_DONE <phase>` before starting the next.
> If `pathly-fsm-call` is unavailable, skip silently — never block execution.

## FSM operations

Events are logged to the central DB via `pathly_orchestrator.eventlog.append_event`.
Every event must include `"ts": "<iso-timestamp>"` using the current ISO-8601 UTC time.
State snapshots are written to `pathly/plans/<feature>/STATE.json` by the FSM server (the skill never writes STATE.json directly).

- **Log event:** `python3 -c "from pathly_orchestrator.eventlog import append_event; append_event('<feature_path>', {'type': 'FILE_CREATED', 'file': '<filename>', 'ts': '<iso-timestamp>'})"`
- **Log retry:** Same pattern with `{'type': 'RETRY', 'key': 'conv-N:FILE.md', 'ts': '<iso-timestamp>'}`.
- **Check retry count:** `python3 -c "from pathly_orchestrator.db import get_db; c=get_db(); print(c.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fsm_events WHERE feature=? AND event_type='RETRY' AND json_extract(payload,'$.key')=?\",('<feature>','conv-N:FILE.md')).fetchone()[0])"`
- **Log human response:** Same pattern with `{'type': 'HUMAN_RESPONSE', 'value': '<value>', 'ts': '<iso-timestamp>'}`.
- **Never** append `STATE_TRANSITION` events — the FSM writes all state transitions after your AGENT_DONE.

## Subagents (REVIEWING stage)

| Action | Spawn |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Analyze changes | `reviewer` (phase: analyze) |
| Phase 2 — Scout context | `scout` or `quick` with `ROLE: reviewer` |
| Phase 3 — Review | `reviewer` (phase: review) |
| Fix architectural violations | `architect` |
| Fix implementation violations | `builder` |

## Rigor gate

- `lite`: reviewer runs once after the **final** builder conversation, unless any of these apply:
  feedback files exist, risky files were touched, or user preference requires per-conversation review.
  If this is not the final conversation and none of those conditions apply → skip directly to Advance.
- `standard` or `strict`: reviewer runs after **every** builder conversation.

log-phase PHASE_START review

## Phase 0 — Record review start time

Run: `python -c "import time; print(int(time.time()))"` and note the printed integer as `REVIEW_START`.

## Phase 1 — Analyze

log-phase PHASE_START analyze

**Spawn** `reviewer` with `phase: analyze` (see Scout choreography for the NEEDS_CONTEXT contract):
```
phase: analyze
Conv N of [feature] — scan the diff to identify what context you need before reviewing.
Run: git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
Read pathly/plans/[feature]/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md if it exists.
List what you need — output NEEDS_CONTEXT block only.

Always include at minimum:
  - type: scout | scope: CLAUDE.md, .claude/rules/, pathly/plans/[feature]/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md | question: what architectural rules and coding conventions apply to the changed files?

Output `none` if the default rules scout above is sufficient.
```
If the block is `none`, use only the default rules scout in Phase 2.

log-phase PHASE_DONE analyze

## Phase 2 — Scout

log-phase PHASE_START scout

Run the Scout choreography with `ROLE: reviewer`. Compress all findings into a short summary for Phase 3.

log-phase PHASE_DONE scout

## Phase 3 — Review

log-phase PHASE_START review

**Spawn** `reviewer` with `phase: review` and scout findings injected:
```
phase: review
Review the changes from conversation N of [feature].
Run: git diff HEAD~1 HEAD (or git diff --staged if not yet committed).

## Applicable Rules and Context (from pre-review scout)
[compressed findings]

Check against these rules and pathly/plans/[feature]/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md.
If architectural violations found: write pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/ARCH_FEEDBACK.md
If implementation violations found: write pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/REVIEW_FAILURES.md
Use the shared feedback protocol formats.
If all clear: report PASS.
```

log-phase PHASE_DONE review

## Feedback routing after reviewer

Apply the Feedback protocol retry-count guard before routing each file (escalate to
HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md when the retry limit is exceeded).

### If `ARCH_FEEDBACK.md` exists

After the retry guard, **spawn** `architect`:
```
Read pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/ARCH_FEEDBACK.md.
Redesign the affected architecture in pathly/plans/[feature]/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md,
or pathly/plans/[feature]/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for lite plans without ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md.
If phases need to change, update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
Delete pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/ARCH_FEEDBACK.md when resolved.
Report: what changed in the design.
```
After architect resolves: log file deleted for ARCH_FEEDBACK.md.
Return. Orchestrator determines next state from transition_rules.

### If `REVIEW_FAILURES.md` exists (no ARCH_FEEDBACK.md)

After the retry guard, **spawn** `builder`:
```
Read pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/REVIEW_FAILURES.md.
Fix each violation listed. Do not change anything outside the listed violations.
Delete pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/REVIEW_FAILURES.md when all fixed.
```

**Guard — zero-diff stall check** (before re-spawning reviewer):
```bash
git diff HEAD -- . ":(exclude)pathly/plans/"
```
- If command fails: skip check, print `[FSM WARNING] git diff failed — skipping zero-diff check`.
- If output is **empty** (no code changed):
  Write `pathly/plans/[feature]/feedback/HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md`:
  ```
  [STALL] Conversation N — builder and reviewer in zero-diff loop.
  Builder claimed to fix REVIEW_FAILURES.md but no code changed.
  Human decision required: accept as-is, override the rule, or rewrite the conversation scope.
  ```
  Log `{"type": "NO_DIFF_DETECTED", "ts": "<iso-timestamp>"}` via `python3 -c "from pathly_orchestrator.eventlog import append_event; append_event('<feature_path>', {'type':'NO_DIFF_DETECTED','ts':'<iso-timestamp>'})"`.
  Stop: "Zero-diff loop detected for Conv N. Escalated to HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md."
- If output is **non-empty**: re-run from Phase 1 — Analyze above.

### If no feedback files — PASS

Run the Completion report with `agent: reviewer`, `result: PASS`, using `REVIEW_START` from Phase 0.

## Advance

If not autoFlow — pause:
```
[Stage 3 — Conversation N complete + reviewed]
Reviewer: PASS. Commit your changes now.
Reply 'continue' for the next conversation, or 'stop' to pause here.
```
- Proceed signal: log human response with reply value. Advance.
- Stop signal: log human response "stop". Halt.
- Unrecognised: re-prompt without logging.

If autoFlow: log human response "auto-advance".

Mark Conv N as DONE in `pathly/plans/[feature]/PROGRESS.md`.

**Write-or-delete transition artifacts:**
- If REVIEW_FAILURES.md was written this run: it already exists — keep it.
  If reviewer passed cleanly (no REVIEW_FAILURES.md written): delete `<storage_path>/feedback/REVIEW_FAILURES.md` if it exists.

Return. Orchestrator determines next state from transition_rules.

## Live progress logging

Each `log-phase PHASE_START <phase>` or `log-phase PHASE_DONE <phase>` marker is a mandatory
pipeline event. When you encounter one (or an inline `Run:` bash block replacing it), execute it immediately:

Run:
```bash
# On PHASE_START:
pathly-fsm-call record-phase \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --agent "<agent>" \
  --phase "<phase>" \
  --event-type PHASE_START \
  --project-root "<project_root>"

# On PHASE_DONE:
pathly-fsm-call record-phase \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --agent "<agent>" \
  --phase "<phase>" \
  --event-type PHASE_DONE \
  --project-root "<project_root>"
```

- `<feature>` — the feature slug (folder name under `pathly/plans/`)
- `<agent>` — the current agent role (`builder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `designer`, etc.)
- `<phase>` — one of `analyze`, `scout`, `implement`, `review`, `test`, `plan`, `design`, `storm`

**Server availability — start-if-needed (same contract as log-agent-done):**

If `pathly-fsm-call` fails or the server is not reachable:
1. Start the server in the background: `pathly-fsm-http`
2. Wait 2 seconds, then retry the `record-phase` call once.
3. If the retry also fails: skip silently and continue — phase logging must never block execution.

This makes phase logging reliable on any adapter (Codex, Copilot, CLI) where the
FSM server is not automatically managed by the host environment.

## Completion report (AGENT_DONE)

After the stage agent completes, write an AGENT_DONE event to the **central DB** via eventlog.
This is **mandatory** — the supervisor reads this event as the authoritative result.

1. Compute wall_seconds: `python3 -c "import time; print(int(time.time()) - BUILD_START)"`
2. Sum `total_tokens` and `tool_uses` across **ALL** subagents spawned during this stage (analyze, scouts, implement/review, and every fix/retry iteration). Parse each subagent's `<usage>` block (look for `subagent_tokens:` and `tool_uses:` lines in the tool result) and add to running totals. `duration_ms = 0` if absent.
3. Compute `cost_usd` from `total_tokens` and `model` using an 80/20 input/output token split:

   | Model prefix | Input $/MTok | Output $/MTok |
   |---|---|---|
   | `claude-opus-4` | 15.00 | 75.00 |
   | `claude-sonnet-4` | 3.00 | 15.00 |
   | `claude-haiku-4` | 0.80 | 4.00 |
   | other / unknown | — | set `cost_usd = 0.0` |

   Formula:
   ```
   in_est  = total_tokens * 0.8
   out_est = total_tokens * 0.2
   cost_usd = round((in_est / 1_000_000 * input_rate) + (out_est / 1_000_000 * output_rate), 6)
   ```

4. Write the event — **do not invoke a skill**, run this command:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, datetime, pathlib
ts = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
event = {
  'type': 'AGENT_DONE',
  'agent': 'AGENT_ROLE',
  'model': 'MODEL_ID',
  'conversation': CONV_N,
  'result': 'DONE',
  'summary': 'SUMMARY_SENTENCE',
  'total_tokens': TOTAL_TOKENS,
  'tool_uses': TOOL_USES,
  'wall_seconds': WALL_SECONDS,
  'cost_usd': COST_USD,
  'ts': ts,
  'schema_version': 1,
}

_written = False

# Primary path: POST to HTTP endpoint
try:
    import urllib.request, urllib.error
    body = json.dumps({
        'type': event['type'],
        'feature': '<feature>',
        'project_root': str(pathlib.Path.cwd()),
        'payload': event,
    }).encode('utf-8')
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        'http://127.0.0.1:8765/runner/event',
        data=body,
        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        method='POST',
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=3) as resp:
        if resp.status == 200:
            print('AGENT_DONE written via HTTP /runner/event')
            _written = True
except Exception:
    pass  # server unreachable — fall through to local fallback

# Fallback: write via eventlog (DB-primary, EVENTS.jsonl secondary)
if not _written:
    try:
        from pathly_orchestrator.eventlog import append_event as _ae
        _ae('pathly/plans/<feature>', event)
        print('AGENT_DONE written to DB (fallback)')
    except Exception as _exc:
        path = pathlib.Path('pathly/plans/<feature>/EVENTS.jsonl')
        path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        with open(path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as _f:
            _f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
        print(f'AGENT_DONE written to EVENTS.jsonl (last resort: {_exc})')

# Always dual-write to EVENTS.jsonl as backup
path = pathlib.Path('pathly/plans/<feature>/EVENTS.jsonl')
path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
with open(path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as _f:
    _f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
```

5. POST to the activity log — non-blocking; skip silently if server is unavailable:

```bash
pathly-fsm-call record-activity \
  --agent "AGENT_ROLE" \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --summary "SUMMARY_SENTENCE" \
  --conversation CONV_N \
  --model "MODEL_ID" \
  --total-tokens TOTAL_TOKENS \
  --tool-uses TOOL_USES \
  --wall-seconds WALL_SECONDS \
  --cost-usd COST_USD
```

Replace the UPPER_CASE placeholders with actual values:
- `AGENT_ROLE` — e.g. `builder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `planner`
- `MODEL_ID` — model used in this stage (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- `CONV_N` — integer conversation number (0 for non-build stages like plan/review/test)
- `SUMMARY_SENTENCE` — one sentence: what was done and the outcome
- `TOTAL_TOKENS`, `TOOL_USES`, `WALL_SECONDS` — from `<usage>` block or wall_seconds computation
- `COST_USD` — computed in step 3

`<feature>` and `<feature_path>` are pre-substituted by the runner — use the values as written.

Return. The orchestrator determines the next state from `transition_rules`.

## Scout choreography (analyze → scout → compress)

The stage agent (builder / reviewer / tester) declares what context it needs *before* doing the
work, scouts gather that context in parallel, and the findings are compressed into the work prompt.

### Phase 1 — Analyze

Spawn the stage agent with `phase: analyze`. It outputs a `## NEEDS_CONTEXT` block **only** —
the list of things it must know before implementing / reviewing / testing.

NEEDS_CONTEXT format (one entry per line):
```
  - type: scout | scope: <files or directories> | question: <specific question>
  - type: quick | question: <specific question>
```

Parse the `## NEEDS_CONTEXT` block. If it says `none`, skip Phase 2 (or use only the stage's
default scout entry, where one is defined).

### Phase 2 — Scout (parallel, max 4)

Spawn all NEEDS_CONTEXT entries in parallel (max 4 total):
- `type: quick` → spawn `quick` with `ROLE: <stage agent>` + the question
- `type: scout` → spawn `scout` with `ROLE: <stage agent>` + scope + question

After each scout/quick returns, parse its `<usage>` block (`subagent_tokens`, `tool_uses`) and
record it immediately — non-blocking, skip if server unavailable:

```bash
# For each scout that returned — replace placeholders with actual values from <usage> block
# model is claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 for scout/quick agents
pathly-fsm-call record-activity \
  --agent "scout" \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --summary "<question truncated to 80 chars>" \
  --conversation N \
  --model "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" \
  --total-tokens SCOUT_TOKENS \
  --tool-uses SCOUT_TOOL_USES \
  --wall-seconds 0 \
  --cost-usd SCOUT_COST_USD
```

Compute `SCOUT_COST_USD` using haiku rates (input $0.80/MTok, output $4.00/MTok) with 80/20 split.
Add each scout's `SCOUT_TOKENS` to the stage running total for the final AGENT_DONE.

Compress all returned findings into a short summary and inject it into the Phase 3 work prompt
as the stage's findings section.

---

---
## Feedback protocol

All feedback files live in `<feature_path>/feedback/`. File exists = issue open.
Absent = resolved.

Priority order (highest first): `HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md` › `ARCH_FEEDBACK.md` › `DESIGN_QUESTIONS.md` ›
`IMPL_QUESTIONS.md` › `REFLECT_CRITIQUE.md` › `REVIEW_FAILURES.md` › `TEST_FAILURES.md`

When you write a feedback file, use the shared feedback protocol formats and then report blocked.
The orchestrator routes the highest-priority open file to the responsible agent, one at a time,
before advancing.

### Guard — feedback-open check

Before spawning the stage agent, scan `<feature_path>/feedback/`. If any file exists:
1. Identify the highest-priority file using the order above.
2. Log file created for that file.
3. Route to the responsible agent (see the stage's feedback routing section).
4. When resolved and the file is deleted: log file deleted. Re-scan.
5. Only proceed when no feedback files remain.

### Guard — retry-count check

Before routing any feedback file to its agent:
1. Check the retry count for `conv-N:FILE.md` from the central DB:
   `python3 -c "from pathly_orchestrator.db import get_db; c=get_db(); print(c.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fsm_events WHERE feature=? AND event_type='RETRY' AND json_extract(payload,'$.key')=?\",('<feature>','conv-N:FILE.md')).fetchone()[0])"`
2. If > 2: write `HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md` with an escalation message, log file created for
   `HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md`. Stop and report the retry limit exceeded.
3. If ≤ 2: after routing the fix agent, log retry for `conv-N:FILE.md`.

Max 2 feedback cycles per conversation per feedback file. If exceeded, escalate to
`HUMAN_QUESTIONS.md`.

Exception: `IMPL_QUESTIONS.md` and `DESIGN_QUESTIONS.md` are clarification requests — exempt
from retry counting.

## Sub-agent spawning rules

This stage runs on a host that can spawn sub-agents (Task / subagent capability).

- **Never execute work yourself** — spawn the right subagent for each step.
- Treat the FSM as a deterministic filesystem machine: read disk, process one event, emit one action.
- After every agent completes, check for feedback files before advancing.
- Spawn scouts and parallel workers up to a maximum of 4 at once.

Map each action to its subagent (the stage skill lists the exact roles for that stage):

| Action | Spawn |
|---|---|
| Implement | `builder` |
| Review changes | `reviewer` |
| Verify acceptance criteria | `tester` |
| Clarify requirement | `planner` |
| Clarify / redesign architecture | `architect` |
| Scout context | `scout` or `quick` (with `ROLE:` set to the stage agent) |

## Posting to the Comms Board

After you finish your work and write your output file(s), mirror the key finding or decision to
the comms board. This makes it visible to every other agent and to Studio **without** them having
to open your file. The board is read back into every agent's prompt automatically.

This is one-directional broadcast — you post and continue. It never blocks your work, and it is
advisory: if the FSM server is unreachable, skip it silently (your output file is the authority).

### Choose the type that fits what you produced

| What you found | type | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| A decision the team must accept | `decision` | design choice, rigor level, scope cut, review/test PASS |
| A constraint future agents must respect | `constraint` | arch rule, API limit, known incompatibility |
| A factual discovery, no action needed yet | `discovery` | explorer finding, root cause identified |
| A violation or risk that blocks progress | `warning` | review failure, test failure, security issue |
| A completed output file | `artifact` | DESIGN.md, CONCLUSIONS.md, RETRO.md, REVIEW_FAILURES.md |

### How to post

For each finding (one post per finding — not one per file line), POST to the board. Replace
`<feature>` with the feature slug, `<your-role>` with your agent role (`reviewer`, `tester`,
`designer`, `explorer`, `builder`, `planner`, …), and `<CURRENT_STATE>` with the active FSM stage.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/comms/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feature": "<feature>",
    "from": "<your-role>",
    "type": "<type>",
    "text": "<one self-contained paragraph — what you found and why it matters>",
    "board": "feature",
    "stage": "<CURRENT_STATE>"
  }'
```

**Server availability — skip-if-down (advisory):**
If the call fails or the server is not reachable (connection refused / non-200), skip silently and
continue. The board is a convenience mirror; your output file is the source of truth. Do **not**
start the server or retry in a loop just to post.

### Rules

- One post per finding, not one per file line.
- `text` must be self-contained — other agents read this without opening your file.
- Post `warning` items **before** writing the feedback file, so Studio shows them in real time.
- Post an `artifact` **after** the file is written, with the file path inside `text`.
- Never paste full file content — summarize in ≤ 3 sentences.
- Only `feature`-scope writes are unrestricted. `project`/`global` writes are role-gated and may
  return 403 — that is expected; keep your post at `"board": "feature"` unless you are `director`/`human`.

### What each role typically posts

| Role / stage | After writing | Post |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewer` (REVIEWING) | `REVIEW_FAILURES.md` | one `warning` per BLOCKER/MAJOR finding; one `decision` ("Review PASS") on a clean pass |
| `tester` (TESTING) | `TEST_FAILURES.md` | one `warning` per failing acceptance criterion; one `decision` ("Tests PASS") on pass |
| `designer` (DESIGNING) | `DESIGN.md` | one `artifact` summarizing the design system (stack, palette, type, key choices) |
| `explorer` (any) | `CONCLUSIONS.md` | one `discovery` per significant finding |
| `builder` (debugging) | `DEBUG_REPORT.md` | one `discovery` for the root cause; one `decision` for the chosen fix |
| `planner` (RETRO) | `RETRO.md` | one `artifact` summarizing lessons; one `decision` per accepted instruction patch |

### Asking a question (non-blocking)

When you need a human decision but must **not** block, post a `question` with 2–4 options.
You continue working on the assumption stated in `text`; if a human answers, the answer is
injected at the next `/next_action`. Never wait in a loop for the reply.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/comms/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feature": "<feature>",
    "from": "<your-role>",
    "type": "question",
    "text": "<the question + the assumption you are proceeding with if unanswered>",
    "options": [
      {"id": "a", "label": "<option A>", "description": "<short consequence>"},
      {"id": "b", "label": "<option B>", "description": "<short consequence>"}
    ],
    "board": "feature",
    "stage": "<CURRENT_STATE>"
  }'
```

Rules:
- Always state your fallback assumption in `text` — the question is advisory, not a gate.
- 2–4 options, each with a one-line `description` of its consequence.
- One question per genuinely-open decision; do not turn routine work into questions.
- The human answer arrives via `/comms/answer`; you read it from the injected board context
  on your next turn. Do not poll.
