# review

This is the canonical, tool-agnostic Pathly behavior for the review workflow.
Adapter skills should load and follow this prompt instead of duplicating workflow logic.

> Shared protocols — **Scout choreography**, **Sub-agent spawning rules**, and **Live progress
> logging** — are composed in below from fragments. This body covers only the interactive
> review-workflow specifics (including its own pipeline exit contract).

## Workflow Surface

This core prompt uses host-neutral Pathly route names. Adapters are responsible
for rendering those routes in their host-native form.

Review code at $ARGUMENTS against this project's architectural standards.

- `staged` or empty → review `git diff --staged`
- `last` → review `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`
- file path → review that specific file
- `<feature> <N>` (e.g. `pathly-observability 2`) → **pipeline review**: review `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`, load that feature's `ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md` for scope context, then run the exit contract on pass/fail

## Pre-review context gathering

**Phase 1 — Analyze:**
log-phase PHASE_START analyze

Spawn `reviewer` with `phase: analyze`. Pass the diff target (`$ARGUMENTS`).
Parse the returned `## NEEDS_CONTEXT` block.

log-phase PHASE_DONE analyze

**Phase 2 — Scout:**
log-phase PHASE_START scout

Run the Scout choreography with `ROLE: reviewer`. Use the returned summary as findings
(`none` if `NEEDS_CONTEXT` was `none`).

log-phase PHASE_DONE scout (include scouts_count = number of entries spawned, or 0 if skipped)

**Phase 3 — Review:**
log-phase PHASE_START review

Spawn `reviewer` with the full review prompt. Inject:
```
## Applicable Rules
[compressed summary from Phase 2, or "none" if skipped]
```
Keep Steps 1–3 and the report format inside the reviewer's spawn prompt.

log-phase PHASE_DONE review

## Step 1 — Get the diff

Run the appropriate git diff command based on `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Step 2 — Load project rules

Read (if present):
1. The `ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md` in the `pathly/plans/*/` folder that most closely matches the changed files — defines the intended architecture for in-progress work
2. Project rule files — project-wide architectural contracts

If neither exists, review against general software engineering good practices and note the absence.

## Step 3 — Check for violations

For each changed file, check:

### Dependency direction
- Does the file import from a layer it should not depend on?
- Does the dependency direction match what `ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md` specifies?

### Layer responsibility
- Does the file contain logic that belongs in a different layer?
- Are concerns properly separated (e.g., data access vs. business logic vs. presentation)?

### Conventions
- Does the file follow naming and structural conventions shown in project rules?
- Are interfaces and contracts implemented correctly per the rules files?

### Scope
- Does the change touch files outside the scope described in the active conversation plan?
- Are there unexpected side effects on other modules?

## Report format

List each check as PASS / FAIL / N/A.

For failures use these prefixes:
```
[ARCH] <file>:<line> — <what the violation is> — <what it should be instead>
[IMPL] <file>:<line> — <what the violation is> — <fix required>
```

If all checks pass: `PASS — no violations found.`

If violations found: list each one. Do NOT auto-fix. Report only.

## Exit contract (pipeline review only — when called as `<feature> <N>`)

**On PASS:**

1. Update `pathly/plans/<feature>/PROGRESS.md` — in the Conversation Breakdown table, find the row for conversation `<N>` and change its Status cell from `TODO` to `DONE`.
2. Check PROGRESS.md: if all conversation rows are now `DONE`, next state = `"TESTING"`; otherwise next state = `"BUILDING"`.
3. Write `pathly/plans/<feature>/STATE.json`:
   ```json
   {"current": "<next_state>", "feature": "<feature>", "rigor": "<rigor>", "updated_at": "<iso-timestamp>"}
   ```
4. Invoke the `log-agent-done` skill with:
   ```json
   {"agent":"reviewer","feature":"<feature>","conversation":<N>,"result":"PASS"}
   ```

**On FAIL:**

1. Write violations to `pathly/plans/<feature>/feedback/REVIEW_FAILURES.md`.
2. Write `pathly/plans/<feature>/STATE.json` with `"current": "REVIEW_FAILED"`.
3. Do NOT update PROGRESS.md — the conversation is not DONE until violations are resolved.

## Live progress logging

Each `log-phase PHASE_START <phase>` or `log-phase PHASE_DONE <phase>` marker is a mandatory
pipeline event. When you encounter one (or an inline `Run:` bash block replacing it), execute it immediately:

Run:
```bash
# On PHASE_START:
pathly-fsm-call record-phase \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --agent "<agent>" \
  --phase "<phase>" \
  --event-type PHASE_START \
  --project-root "<project_root>"

# On PHASE_DONE:
pathly-fsm-call record-phase \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --agent "<agent>" \
  --phase "<phase>" \
  --event-type PHASE_DONE \
  --project-root "<project_root>"
```

- `<feature>` — the feature slug (folder name under `pathly/plans/`)
- `<agent>` — the current agent role (`builder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `designer`, etc.)
- `<phase>` — one of `analyze`, `scout`, `implement`, `review`, `test`, `plan`, `design`, `storm`

**Server availability — start-if-needed (same contract as log-agent-done):**

If `pathly-fsm-call` fails or the server is not reachable:
1. Start the server in the background: `pathly-fsm-http`
2. Wait 2 seconds, then retry the `record-phase` call once.
3. If the retry also fails: skip silently and continue — phase logging must never block execution.

This makes phase logging reliable on any adapter (Codex, Copilot, CLI) where the
FSM server is not automatically managed by the host environment.

## Scout choreography (analyze → scout → compress)

The stage agent (builder / reviewer / tester) declares what context it needs *before* doing the
work, scouts gather that context in parallel, and the findings are compressed into the work prompt.

### Phase 1 — Analyze

Spawn the stage agent with `phase: analyze`. It outputs a `## NEEDS_CONTEXT` block **only** —
the list of things it must know before implementing / reviewing / testing.

NEEDS_CONTEXT format (one entry per line):
```
  - type: scout | scope: <files or directories> | question: <specific question>
  - type: quick | question: <specific question>
```

Parse the `## NEEDS_CONTEXT` block. If it says `none`, skip Phase 2 (or use only the stage's
default scout entry, where one is defined).

### Phase 2 — Scout (parallel, max 4)

Spawn all NEEDS_CONTEXT entries in parallel (max 4 total):
- `type: quick` → spawn `quick` with `ROLE: <stage agent>` + the question
- `type: scout` → spawn `scout` with `ROLE: <stage agent>` + scope + question

After each scout/quick returns, parse its `<usage>` block (`subagent_tokens`, `tool_uses`) and
record it immediately — non-blocking, skip if server unavailable:

```bash
# For each scout that returned — replace placeholders with actual values from <usage> block
# model is claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 for scout/quick agents
pathly-fsm-call record-activity \
  --agent "scout" \
  --feature "<feature>" \
  --summary "<question truncated to 80 chars>" \
  --conversation N \
  --model "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" \
  --total-tokens SCOUT_TOKENS \
  --tool-uses SCOUT_TOOL_USES \
  --wall-seconds 0 \
  --cost-usd SCOUT_COST_USD
```

Compute `SCOUT_COST_USD` using haiku rates (input $0.80/MTok, output $4.00/MTok) with 80/20 split.
Add each scout's `SCOUT_TOKENS` to the stage running total for the final AGENT_DONE.

Compress all returned findings into a short summary and inject it into the Phase 3 work prompt
as the stage's findings section.

## Sub-agent spawning rules

This stage runs on a host that can spawn sub-agents (Task / subagent capability).

- **Never execute work yourself** — spawn the right subagent for each step.
- Treat the FSM as a deterministic filesystem machine: read disk, process one event, emit one action.
- After every agent completes, check for feedback files before advancing.
- Spawn scouts and parallel workers up to a maximum of 4 at once.

Map each action to its subagent (the stage skill lists the exact roles for that stage):

| Action | Spawn |
|---|---|
| Implement | `builder` |
| Review changes | `reviewer` |
| Verify acceptance criteria | `tester` |
| Clarify requirement | `planner` |
| Clarify / redesign architecture | `architect` |
| Scout context | `scout` or `quick` (with `ROLE:` set to the stage agent) |

## Posting to the Comms Board

After you finish your work and write your output file(s), mirror the key finding or decision to
the comms board. This makes it visible to every other agent and to Studio **without** them having
to open your file. The board is read back into every agent's prompt automatically.

This is one-directional broadcast — you post and continue. It never blocks your work, and it is
advisory: if the FSM server is unreachable, skip it silently (your output file is the authority).

### Choose the type that fits what you produced

| What you found | type | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| A decision the team must accept | `decision` | design choice, rigor level, scope cut, review/test PASS |
| A constraint future agents must respect | `constraint` | arch rule, API limit, known incompatibility |
| A factual discovery, no action needed yet | `discovery` | explorer finding, root cause identified |
| A violation or risk that blocks progress | `warning` | review failure, test failure, security issue |
| A completed output file | `artifact` | DESIGN.md, CONCLUSIONS.md, RETRO.md, REVIEW_FAILURES.md |

### How to post

For each finding (one post per finding — not one per file line), POST to the board. Replace
`<feature>` with the feature slug, `<your-role>` with your agent role (`reviewer`, `tester`,
`designer`, `explorer`, `builder`, `planner`, …), and `<CURRENT_STATE>` with the active FSM stage.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/comms/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feature": "<feature>",
    "from": "<your-role>",
    "type": "<type>",
    "text": "<one self-contained paragraph — what you found and why it matters>",
    "board": "feature",
    "stage": "<CURRENT_STATE>"
  }'
```

**Server availability — skip-if-down (advisory):**
If the call fails or the server is not reachable (connection refused / non-200), skip silently and
continue. The board is a convenience mirror; your output file is the source of truth. Do **not**
start the server or retry in a loop just to post.

### Rules

- One post per finding, not one per file line.
- `text` must be self-contained — other agents read this without opening your file.
- Post `warning` items **before** writing the feedback file, so Studio shows them in real time.
- Post an `artifact` **after** the file is written, with the file path inside `text`.
- Never paste full file content — summarize in ≤ 3 sentences.
- Only `feature`-scope writes are unrestricted. `project`/`global` writes are role-gated and may
  return 403 — that is expected; keep your post at `"board": "feature"` unless you are `director`/`human`.

### What each role typically posts

| Role / stage | After writing | Post |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewer` (REVIEWING) | `REVIEW_FAILURES.md` | one `warning` per BLOCKER/MAJOR finding; one `decision` ("Review PASS") on a clean pass |
| `tester` (TESTING) | `TEST_FAILURES.md` | one `warning` per failing acceptance criterion; one `decision` ("Tests PASS") on pass |
| `designer` (DESIGNING) | `DESIGN.md` | one `artifact` summarizing the design system (stack, palette, type, key choices) |
| `explorer` (any) | `CONCLUSIONS.md` | one `discovery` per significant finding |
| `builder` (debugging) | `DEBUG_REPORT.md` | one `discovery` for the root cause; one `decision` for the chosen fix |
| `planner` (RETRO) | `RETRO.md` | one `artifact` summarizing lessons; one `decision` per accepted instruction patch |

### Asking a question (non-blocking)

When you need a human decision but must **not** block, post a `question` with 2–4 options.
You continue working on the assumption stated in `text`; if a human answers, the answer is
injected at the next `/next_action`. Never wait in a loop for the reply.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/comms/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "feature": "<feature>",
    "from": "<your-role>",
    "type": "question",
    "text": "<the question + the assumption you are proceeding with if unanswered>",
    "options": [
      {"id": "a", "label": "<option A>", "description": "<short consequence>"},
      {"id": "b", "label": "<option B>", "description": "<short consequence>"}
    ],
    "board": "feature",
    "stage": "<CURRENT_STATE>"
  }'
```

Rules:
- Always state your fallback assumption in `text` — the question is advisory, not a gate.
- 2–4 options, each with a one-line `description` of its consequence.
- One question per genuinely-open decision; do not turn routine work into questions.
- The human answer arrives via `/comms/answer`; you read it from the injected board context
  on your next turn. Do not poll.
